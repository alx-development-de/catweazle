In the production of industrial control cabinets, we repeatedly encounter the same difficulties, such as:

* Orders are canceled due to the shortage of skilled workers.
* High paper costs and long communication channels
* Employees are increasingly occupied with routine tasks
* Quality suffers from the lack of personnel
* Complexity increases steadily, demands on personnel grow
* Supply bottlenecks expose supply chain problems

Not everything can be solved technologically, but there are many ways to reduce complexity or to streamline and accelerate processes. Important here is the automation of routine tasks in engineering and production and the increase in quality through automated tests and checklists, as well as the implementation of lean principles in digital processes as well.

With the CATweazle project, I would like to create a basis for this by optimally combining and intelligently linking different tools for the control cabinet. The focus here is particularly on the use of freely available (preferably open source) software.

The biggest challenge is usually the compilation and connection in different runtime environments. Through modern methods such as *Docker*, virtual servers can be built in a standardized way and prefabricated combinations can be created. CATweazle is based therefore on this principle and uses the virtualization technology for the structure. In particular *docker-compose* is used here and this repository provides the necessary scripts for this.
